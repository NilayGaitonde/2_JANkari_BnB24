Use a pre-trained model to perform plant classification and disease detection
Use models like ResNet or VGG-16.

Plant-Village-Dataset is great

Can make a streamlit app and host it essentially instantly

Kaggle has dataset already uploaded, both of us have enough hours combined for the GPU

^seems like we can just do the above, use tensorflow and kaggle and download the weights of the model.
