We (artists) need to be able to upload music to a decentralised platform.
	We can use IPFS for the same -> ipfsapi

The music once downloaded can be protected using DRM,,, or we can embed the smart contract
into the file (a makeshift DRM) that does not allow file to play or deletes itself when the 
terms of the smart contracts aren't met -> pallycon

can use the Ethereum network as the blockchain network

The main issue -> avoid users from sharing bought and downloaded music files,,, this can be 
fixed using DRM^

Use the decentralised database -> ipfs and make UI that creates a IPFS node whenever an artist
uploads their songs...

There will be a need for a centralised database that stores all metadata -> which album things 
are in maybe the song saved in the node has that saved as metadata -> all songs which have the
same album id will be grouped together

local playlists in our application will be a local database,,, sharability of playlists can leverage
a cdn, like discord, where the playlist is basically a file which gets uploaded,,, and you can just pull
it and save it.


No need to think about security flaws right now,,, will get bogged down

Features uptil now:
	decentralised distribution of music
	no middle men to upload music
	users can own music
	downloaded music is protected using DRM
		or a proprietary file format where a smart contract must be fulfilled
		before each play, within our file system; this will need to be cached
		as it will be very slow to play a song otherwise
	playlists are saved locally - can be shared using CDNs (or p2p networks)

	each download requires payment (via smart contracts) to go through regardless, 
	therefore that is trivial. 


Have to figure out how to save number of streams per music to allow for royalty distribution??
