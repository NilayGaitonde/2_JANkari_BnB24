# 2_JANkari_BnB24
This project is a submission for the BIT N BUILD 2024 Maharashtra held in 17th-18th February

The problem statement we are working on:  

Develop an AI/MLdriven plant growth monitoring system that utilizes mobile camera technology
to capture images for analysis of key growth factors such as plant size, leaf color, and overall health. 
The system should employ machine learning algorithms to process these images in real-time, providing 
insights into plant health and growth. Additionally, the model should evaluate the plant species
and provide tailored recommendations, including Do's and Dont's for optimal care, helping farmers 
and gardeners enhance crop yield and plant quality.

The application is created by [Jeet Shah](https://github.com/jeetsh4h) and [Aniket Khetan](https://github.com/aniketkhetan).

The application is hosted on [Streamlit](https://paudhayodha.streamlit.app/) and can be accessed right now. 
Changes to the deployed app are still being made over at [this repository](https://github.com/jeetsh4h/paudhayodha).

To run the application on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Clone the current repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeetsh4h/2_JANkari_BnB24.git
cd 2_JANkari_BnB24/paudhayodha
```
*OR* clone the Paudhayodha repsitory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeetsh4h/paudhayodha.git
```

Build a virtual environment using the following command:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application using the following command:
```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```


_The above application has only been tested with python 3.11_
